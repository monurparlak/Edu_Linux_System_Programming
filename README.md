## Why This Repository?
Linux system programming requires understanding OS-level concepts, process management, memory handling, and inter-process communication. This repository helps you learn through:

- **Learn by Example:** Real-world exercises with executable C code.  
- **Standard & POSIX Driven:** Explanations follow Linux system programming best practices.  
- **Clear & Consistent Formatting:** Structured examples for easy learning.  
- **Interview-Ready Content:** Covers tricky topics like fork/exec, signal handling, IPC mechanisms, and file operations.

---

## Scope & Roadmap
- **Language covered:** C (POSIX/Linux)  
- **For each topic:**
  - Core system calls and their usage  
  - Example-driven exercises  
  - Common pitfalls and debugging tips  
- **Planned deep dives:** Threads & synchronization, sockets and network programming, memory mapping, and advanced IPC mechanisms.
